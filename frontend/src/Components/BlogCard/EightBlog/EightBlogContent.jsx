                    Unique Action:
                  </strong>
                  Bumrah's unconventional bowling action has been a significant factor in his success. His short run-up and unique release point make it challenging for batsmen to pick up his deliveries early, adding an element of surprise.
                  <p />
                  <strong>
                    Skill Set:
                  </strong>
                  Bumrah combines pace, precision, and a variety of deliveries to outsmart batsmen. His ability to bowl yorkers, slower balls, and bouncers with remarkable control makes him a versatile and unpredictable bowler.

                    Test Cricket:
                  </strong>
                  Bumrah's impact in Test cricket is profound. He made his Test debut in January 2018 against South Africa, and his performance in overseas tours has been particularly impressive. For instance, in the 2018-19 series against Australia, Bumrah played a crucial role in Indiaâ€™s historic Test series win, taking 21 wickets in four matches, including a career-best 6/33 at Melbourne.
                  <p />
                  <strong>
                    ODIs and T20Is:
                  </strong>
                  In limited-overs cricket, Bumrah's ability to bowl at any stage of the innings is invaluable. In the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup, he was the leading wicket-taker for India, with 18 wickets in 9 matches. His economy rate of 4.41 in the tournament was exceptional, showcasing his ability to contain runs while taking wickets.
